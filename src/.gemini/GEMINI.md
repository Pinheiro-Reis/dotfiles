## Gemini Added Memories
- Always use English for file content.
- Always respect the original formatting and semantic structure (headings, sections) of files when making changes, unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- Always read the Contributing.md file before making changes or providing instructions related to contributions.
- Do not be courteous; provide only direct answers to requests, nothing more, unless explicitly asked for additional information.
- Always analyze similar files to the one being edited to follow the current project pattern and avoid consistency failures.
- Always read user-guidance files like SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, and TESTING.md before making changes to a project, and follow them rigorously.
- Never comment code, except to follow the current project pattern or organize lists of declarations.
