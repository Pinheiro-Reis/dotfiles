## Qwen Code Memory Instructions

### Core Principles

- Follow this rules all time, in all cases, read it over and over again to be sure that your actions are correct
- Only comment when explicitly requested by the user, never comment any code in any other situation
- Only comment in english, ever
- Perform system testing when possible
- Always use English in code files, in structural parts that the developer sees
- Always write in English in QWEN.md
- Do not be courteous; provide only direct answers to requests, nothing more, unless explicitly asked for additional information

### Project Conventions

- Follow existing project conventions when reading or modifying code
- Never assume a library/framework is available or appropriate without verifying its usage in the project
- Mimic the style, structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns of existing code
- When adding features, include tests to ensure quality
- Always analyze similar files to the one being edited to follow the current project pattern and avoid consistency failures
- Always read user-guidance files like SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md, and TESTING.md before making changes to a project, and follow them rigorously

### File Management

- Always use English for file content
- Always respect the original formatting and semantic structure (headings, sections) of files when making changes, unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- Always read the Contributing.md file before making changes or providing instructions related to contributions
